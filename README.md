# ComBad
ComBad stands for Committers - Bad Code Smells. This program associates the bad code smells found in some GitHub software repositories to their committers.
This is part of my bachelor's degree thesis in Computer Engineering at Unisannio, supervised by professor Giuseppe Antonio Di Lucca, which consists in the analysis of some open-source software systems in order to analyze their quality and understand which of the developers was more inclined to introduce potential code smells.
